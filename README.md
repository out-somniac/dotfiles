# Feroda dotfiles

## What is this repo?

This is where i store many config files.  
If you'd like to config your terminal,  
but don't want to walk through 1600 lines of documentation - here you go :)  

## How to use it?

1. Fonts:  
    If you'd like to use ligatures go ahead and install Fira-Code:  
    - for ArchLinux:  
    ```sudo pacman -S ttf-fira-code```  
    - for Fedora:
    ```sudo dnf install fira-code-fonts```  

    *This is probably a good time to add this font to any IDE you might be using*  
2. Terminal:  
    Just grab `kitt.conf` or `alacritty.yml` and place them in their respective folders:  
    ```.config/kitty/kitty.conf``` or ```.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml```
