# Feroda dotfiles

## What is this repo?

This is where i store many config files.  
If you'd like to config your terminal,  
but don't want to walk through 1600 lines of documentation - here you go :)  

## How to use it?

1. Fonts:  
    If you'd like to use ligatures go ahead and install Fira-Code:  
    - for ArchLinux:  
    ```sudo pacman -S ttf-fira-code```  
    - for Fedora:
    ```sudo dnf install fira-code-fonts```  

    *This is probably a good time to add this font to any IDE you might be using*  

2. Terminal:  
    Just grab `kitt.conf` or `alacritty.yml` and place them in their respective folders:  
    ```.config/kitty/kitty.conf``` or ```.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml``` 

3. Shell prompt:
    I've included the powerline config directory, but coincidentally I forgot how to actually set it up ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.  
    Follow this [documentation](https://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/shell-prompts.html) if you dare.
